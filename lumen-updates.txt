<font size="26"><b>Version 2.4 - 8/8/22</b></font>
I really messed up big time didn't I.
<b>Fixes:</b>
    - Changed the spelling of "Collectables" to the correct "Collectibles"
        > Now your save is gone, whoops! I saved your data under the incorrect spelling and now that it's corrected you have a blank slate.
            > But hey, look on the bright side! Now you get to speedrun collector again.

<font size="26"><b>Version 2.3 - 8/8/22</b></font>
<b>Additions:</b>
    - Added the Redsky Laberynth (yes, another one)
        > Added the taco collectable
        > Added the maze trophy collectable
    - Added new dialog to one of the dolls
    - Added text for the camera unlock keybind
<b>Changes:</b>
    - Tweaked the dummy in the train's dialog
    - Changed the nothing to see here badge to award when entering a proximity portal instead of a hidden door
    - Added black and white lighting when in the house dimension.
    - Disabled the reset character option while in a dimension found via a proximity portal; part of the fun is finding the way back (for some of them)
